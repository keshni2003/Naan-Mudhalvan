Designing a front-end code for a text editor requires creating a user interface that allows users to create, edit, and save text files. Here are some steps to design a front-end code for a text editor:

Create the HTML structure for the text editor interface. This will include a text area for users to input and edit their text, and buttons or menu options to perform actions like save, open, and format the text.

Use CSS to style the text editor interface. This can include customizing the font, color, and layout of the text area and buttons.

Use JavaScript to handle the user input and perform the necessary actions. For example, you might create a function that saves the user's text input to a file when the save button is clicked, or a function that formats the text to a specific style when a menu option is selected.

Add error handling to your code to prevent the user from entering invalid inputs. For example, you might prevent the user from saving a file with an invalid file name or from opening a file that does not exist.

Test your text editor thoroughly to make sure it works as expected
